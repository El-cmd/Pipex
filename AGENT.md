## Working Guidelines
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior and follow the style already present in the touched files.
- Check `README.md`, `Makefile`, package scripts, and Docker files before introducing new commands or tooling.
- Preserve the existing C/C++ layout and Makefile conventions; avoid committing binaries, object files, or local test outputs.
- Do not commit local secrets, `.env` files, generated dependency folders, build artifacts, or editor metadata.

## Setup
- `No explicit dependency install command is defined in the repository.`
